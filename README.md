# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
This project explores the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for forecasting Bitcoin prices using minute-level historical data. The dataset spans from January 1, 2021, to February 2022, with training, validation, and testing sets structured to predict the last 10 days of February 2022. The model utilizes time-series data, focusing on the ”close” price as the target variable. Data preprocessing includes normalization, sequence generation, and DataLoader implementation for efficient training. The performance of the LSTM model is analyzed and compared against traditional statistical methods such as ARIMA, evaluating accuracy, training time, and inference speed. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of deep learning in capturing temporal dependencies in Bitcoin price movements. The study also discusses potential enhancements, including hyperparameter tuning and alternative deep learning architectures, to improve predictive performance.
